They’re actually an introvert, although most people never believe them when they say that. But that's because they can talk for ages about things that interest them or flex their brain capacity. They most often exhaust their social battery at school/work. But they do have a tight-knit group of friends, who, surprise, are also introverts. They have discussions with their friends which brings out their best writings which otherwise would exist only in their head. 

They’re pretty competitive and is always dedicated to the activity that they’re engaged in, almost like tunnel vision and committed to a life of learning. 

In the evening, you can observe the creature lounging on the couch or the bed reading a book or some tech article while fidgeting with whatever their arms, or even legs, can get a hold of. Or, they can be found on their phone or laptop, playing games that totally maxes out their system.
